Hi @<insert_author_profile_name_here>,

Welcome to the club of Kata authors! :D  While you may be inclined to author a Kata whenever an idea pops up in your mind and publish it for the rest of the community to enjoy, you should be aware that [published Kata are expected to meet strict expectations in order to pass the testing stage and leave Beta](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Create-Your-First-Kata).

Please do read through the article linked above before continuing on your journey of authoring Kata.  We're looking forward to more Kata authored by you *once you have read the article mentioned* ;)

Cheers,
@donaldsebleung
